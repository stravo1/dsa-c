# Doubly linked lists
The advantage of a doubly linked list (also called two â€“ way linked list) is that given a node in the list, we can navigate in both directions. A node in a singly linked list cannot be removed unless we have the pointer to its predecessor. Each node has both previous and next pointers. The previous pointer of the head node is NULL.

The primary disadvantages of doubly linked lists are:  
- Each node requires an extra pointer, requiring more space.
- The insertion or deletion of a node takes a bit longer (more pointer operations).
